This is a simple program to parse an html file of the hundred beers in our challenge along with the current checkin status.

It will create a list of beer objects that can later be customized, extended, and reprinted.

TODO:
	- Create Beer Objects
	- Add new descriptions: Availability, Regionality, Cost, Season
	- Create a github projects page to allow public viewing over the web
